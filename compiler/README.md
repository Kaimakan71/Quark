# Quark Compiler
The Quark compiler is the program that turns Quark source code into machine-language that runs on the processor.

# Lexer
The lexer turns an input stream into tokens, which are easier for the parser to understand than just plain text.

# Parser
The parser generates an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), which contains information about how the program works.

# Codegen
The codegen (code generator) generates assembly language code from the operations in the AST.
